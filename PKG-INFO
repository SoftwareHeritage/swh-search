swh-search
==========

Search service for the Software Heritage archive.

It is similar to swh-storage in what it contains,
but provides different ways to query it: while swh-storage is mostly
a key-value store that returns an object from a primary key,
swh-search is focused on reverse indices, to allow finding objects that
match some criteria; for example full-text search.

Currently uses ElasticSearch, and provides only origin search (by URL and metadata)

## Dependencies

- Python tests for this module include tests that cannot be run without a local
ElasticSearch instance, so you need the ElasticSearch server executable on your
machine (no need to have a running ElasticSearch server).

    - Debian-like host

        The elasticsearch package is required. As it's not part of debian-stable,
        [another debian repository is required to be
        configured](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/deb.html#deb-repo)

    - Non Debian-like host

        The tests expect:
        - `/usr/share/elasticsearch/jdk/bin/java` to exist.
        - `org.elasticsearch.bootstrap.Elasticsearch` to be in java's classpath.
- Emscripten is required for generating tree-sitter WASM module. The following commands need to be executed for the setup:
    ```bash
    cd /opt && git clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git && cd emsdk && \
    ./emsdk install latest && ./emsdk activate latest
    PATH="${PATH}:/opt/emsdk/upstream/emscripten"
    ```

    **Note:** If emsdk isn't found in the PATH, the tree-sitter cli automatically pulls `emscripten/emsdk` image from docker hub when `make ts-build-wasm` or `make ts-build` is used.


## Make targets

Below is the list of available make targets that can be executed from the root directory of swh-search in order to build and/or execute the swh-search under various configurations:

* **ts-install**: Install node_modules and emscripten SDK required for TreeSitter

* **ts-generate**: Generate parser files(C and JSON) from the grammar

* **ts-repl**: Starts a web based playground for the TreeSitter grammar. It's the recommended way for developing TreeSitter grammar.

* **ts-dev**: Parse the `query_language/sample_query` and print the corresponding syntax expression
along with the start and end positions of all the nodes.

* **ts-dev sanitize=1**: Same as **ts-dev** but without start and end position of the nodes.
This format is expected by TreeSitter's native test command. `sanitize=1` cleans the output
of **ts-dev** using `sed` to achieve the desired format.

* **ts-test**: executes TreeSitter's native tests

* **ts-build-so**: Generates `swh_ql.so` file from the previously generated parser using py-tree-sitter

* **ts-build-so**: Generates `swh_ql.wasm` file from the previously generated parser using emscripten

* **ts-build**: Executes both **ts-build-so** and **ts-build-so**
