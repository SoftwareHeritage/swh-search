Description: swh-search
        ==========
        
        Search service for the Software Heritage archive.
        
        It is similar to swh-storage in what it contains,
        but provides different ways to query it: while swh-storage is mostly
        a key-value store that returns an object from a primary key,
        swh-search is focused on reverse indices, to allow finding objects that
        match some criteria; for example full-text search.
        
        Currently uses ElasticSearch, and provides only origin search (by URL and metadata)
        
        # Dependencies
        
        Python tests for this module include tests that cannot be run without a local
        ElasticSearch instance, so you need the ElasticSearch server executable on your
        machine (no need to have a running ElasticSearch server).
        
        ## Debian-like host
        
        The elasticsearch package is required. As it's not part of debian-stable,
        [another debian repository is required to be
        configured](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/deb.html#deb-repo)
        
        ## Non Debian-like host
        
        The tests expect:
        - `/usr/share/elasticsearch/jdk/bin/java` to exist.
        - `org.elasticsearch.bootstrap.Elasticsearch` to be in java's classpath.
